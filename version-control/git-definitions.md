**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	* ## Version conrtol is a method used to keep all editions of a project at one source. It is useful because you don't have to depend on one physical machine for a source of code, so if it breaks, you can have the peace of mind that it is located elsewhere. It's also useful if you have a bug in your new edition of you software. You can go through the history of commits to find the bug or rollback to a prior edition until the solution is found.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	* ## A branch is a personal sandbox to experiment with code without blemishing the up to date version (master branch). You have the ability to import the current code to the branch,  make changes and merge the changes to the master branch
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? 
	* ## You can look at a commit as save point  (check point) in a video game. It solidifies a version of your code. A good commit message fully explains the changes you made.

* What is a merge conflict?
	* ## A merge conflict occurs when you are trying to override files that you are currently working on or is in the staging area.
